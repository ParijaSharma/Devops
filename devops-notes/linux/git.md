#what is version control?
    developers workings on the same code 
    code is hosted centrally on the internet
    every developer has an entire copy of the code locally 
    code is fetched from remote repo and pushed to code repo

    gits knows how to merge changes automatically
    merge conflicts - eg: when same line was changed
    best practice is to push and pull often from remote repo 
    this is called continuous integration
    
    -> breaking changes don't affect you until you pull the new code
    -> version control keeps the track of changes
    -> you can revert commits 
    -> each change labeled with commit message

#Basics of Git:

gits has multiple parts:
- Remote Git Repository: where the code lives 
- Local Git Repository : local copy of the code 
- History - of the code changes 
- Staging - changes to commit
- Git client - to execute git commands

# What is a Remote Git repository
different git repositories are available 
Platforms that host your repositories 
companies have their own git servers 
private vs public repositories 
public repositories for open source projects

# how do we get remote repository locally 
step 1 - is to install git client
