# Linux Basics

## File System Navigation
 - `pwd` â†’ Print current working directory.
 - `ls` â†’ List files.
 - `ls -l` â†’ Long format.
 - `ls -lt`  â†’ last time modified , which date it was made , size etc;
 - `ls -ltr`  â†’ it sorts the file in reverse order so you will see latest file at the lowest 
 - `ls -lth`  â†’ for more human readable form we use this 
 - `ls -a` â†’ Show hidden files.
 - `cd <directory>` â†’ Change directory.
 - `cd ..` â†’ Go up one level.
 - `whoami` â†’ to check current user logged in
 - `cd ~` â†’ to go to the home directory

        for searching anything first write {less <file> then / ..... whatever you want to search}
        * shift+G - last line reached
        * P - first line reached
        if you are at end of the file then for searching anything use {?} and not {/}
        press q for quitting
